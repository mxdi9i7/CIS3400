            <p>An online presence is important for outbound marketing because it reinforces your brand and what you offer to your target market. Once you’ve communicated with your audience, you’ll need to have a web presence that helps portray why your product or service is so great – because that’s the next stop for the majority of your potential customers.</p>
            <p>1. Create A Professional Website <br>
                A well designed website that highlights your quality and professionalism should be the first step in launching your online presence.
                These days its so easy to create a great looking website or online store using site builders such as Wix or Squarespace – which require no design or coding knowledge and come with an endless array of templates and design tools to choose from.
                Now that there’s no need to hire a designer or site builder to get your business online, it’s easier than ever to go digital.</p>
            <p>2. Optimize How Visitors Find You In Search Results<br>
               Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the science of directing customers to your website via search engines (the most popular being Google).
               It is the essential and fundamental work applied to your website to make sure your business is seen and ranked by search engines so that you appear higher up in the search results when customers and leads look for you or something related to your business.
               The building blocks of SEO are keywords, which are words or phrases relating to your business. Start by choosing 3 to 5 essential keywords that someone would search for that would lead them to your website.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Increase Your Traffic With Paid Ads<br>
                A relatively easy and quite effective way to drive traffic to your website and boost your online presence is to use paid search advertising. Pay-per-click (PPC) ads allow you to pay for display ads on search engines which appear in the sponsored results section of the search page.
            </p>
            <p> 
                4. Generate Buzz on Social Media<br>
                From Facebook to Twitter, Instagram to LinkedIn, YouTube to Pinterest, and a slew of sites that are popular even if they’re not on the tip of everyone’s tongues (CafeMom, Flickr, and Tumblr, to name a few), social media websites and their respective mobile apps are the best ways to get people talking about your business.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Connect With Blog Influencers<br>
                Blog outreach – working with bloggers to create genuine, authentic content to promote your business – is a public relations-focused tactic whose goal is to create brand awareness without having to purchase placement for your branded content.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Engage In Online Communities<br>
                Online communities (or groups) are comprised of people who share the same interests as your business. Community members have personal profiles, and they post, share, and chat with other members.
                The beauty of online communities as they pertain to growing your web presence is that communities are greatly segmented—by niche, location, language, and many other parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Develop Your Authority in Forums <br>
                If you want to improve your business’s brand awareness and reputation while driving more traffic to your website, you can do so by developing an authoritative voice in pertinent forums.               
            </p>
            <p>
                8. Link to Your Site on Directories<br>
                Having a profile on a local business directory (and certainly, market or industry directories, too) with a link to your business’s website will increase your chances of being seen by leads and customers.
                    
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Inform and Grow Your Audience Using Email<br>
                Utilizing sign-up forms on your website is not only a great way to interact with customers and leads and to keep track of conversions, it is also an incredibly effective way to grow your audience.                
            </p>
            <p>
                10. Analyze for Improvement to Increase Your Online Presence<br>
                Increasing your web presence is a continual process that you can improve upon by analyzing what worked and what did not, which efforts to repeat and continue and which to stop or avoid.
                Google Analytics, Rank Checker, SEOmoz Tools, are some of the best tools to help in your analysis.
